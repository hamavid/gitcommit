<h2>stay at an airbnb</h2>
<p>There are lots of AirBnbs in Seattle. Use the link below if you want to split an AirBnb with other people who are coming to the wedding.</p>

<p>If you are not sure what area to stay in: Fremont, or Wallingford, Greenlake, and Ballard are near the venue, and they all have fun stuff to do. Capitol Hill or Belltown are on or near the lightrail, closer to downtown, and also have fun stuff to do, though are farther from the venue. Other areas might be good too!</p>
<br>
<h2>stay with our friends / host</h2>
<p>Perhaps you just want to stay on a couch? Perhaps you live in Seattle and want to get to know one of our out-of-town friends? That would just warm our hearts. Use the link below to figure out the details.

<h1>Travel</h1>
<div class='info fadeygreen'>
<h2>flying</h2>
<p>The closest major airport to Seattle is SeaTac (SEA). From there, you can get up to Seattle by rental car or Lyft/Uber (~30 minutes), or reserve a spot on a [shuttle](https://shuttleexpress.com/seattle-seatac-airport-transportation/).</p>
<p>You can also take the lightrail: From baggage claim, follow signs for the Link Light Rail (about a 10 minute walk, past the parking garage). Use the ticket machines to buy a single-ride ticket, or get an [ORCA card](https://www.orcacard.com/ERG-Seattle/getACard.do) and tap it, then go up to the train platform. You don't have to give anyone the ticket to get on the train, but hold on to it until you disembark, in case the train cops board to check.</p>

<div class='info fadeygreen'>
<h2>public transit</h2>
<p><!--Public transit is a great way to get around Seattle! It comes with a chauffeur, a VIP lane, and sometimes entertainment.--> Bus fare is $2.75, cash only, no change available. Lightrail fare varies, and you have to get a ticket at the machines at the stations before boarding. You can also use the [Transit Go](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/fares-orca/transit-go-ticket.aspx) app to pay with your phone. Alternatively, [get an ORCA card](https://www.orcacard.com/ERG-Seattle/getACard.do) for $5 and add E-purse value. ORCA cards work for both lightrail and buses and include transfers between them.</p>
<p>[OneBusAway](https://onebusaway.org/) is a local transit app that shows bus and lightrail schedules and which lines come to a given stop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, 10/26-10/27 is one of the weekends with [major construction](https://www.soundtransit.org/get-to-know-us/news-events/news-releases/construction-will-close-light-rail-downtown-seattle-three) planned on the lightrail this fall, so allow extra time for lightrailing. There will be shuttles through downtown, everything will be crowded, and you can't bring that bicycle you had on the plane. We forgot to tell city council about our wedding, sorry.</p>

<h2>walk or bike</h2>
<p>Seattle is very walkable and bikeable. The two bike-share programs currently operating are [Lime](https://www.li.me/) and [Jump](https://www.jump.com/cities/seattle/). (Read about the demise of at least two previous programs [here](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/spin-reportedly-rolling-seattle-leaving-just-one-dockless-bikeshare-service/).) These both include some electric bikes, which are helpful for hills and make you feel like a magical beast. BYO-helmet. Ride safe.</p>
