		<div class="text">
			<p>Arguably the best view of Seattle can be taken in from the iconic <a href="https://www.spaceneedle.com/" target="_blank">Space Needle</a>. The Seattle Center is also home to other classic attractions, such as the <a href="https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/" target="_blank">Pacific Science Center</a> (where they also host laser shows at the <a href="https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/laser-dome/" target="_blank">Laser Dome)</a>, <a href="https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/" target="_blank">Chihuly Garden and Glass</a>, <a href="https://www.mopop.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Pop Culture</a> (MoPOP, formerly known as the EMP) and the <a href="https://www.seattlemonorail.com/" target="_blank">Monorail</a>, which won't take you very far, but it's still a fun (or maybe kind of unnerving) ride.</p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Watching the boats go back and forth through the <a href="http://www.myballard.com/ballard-locks-seattle/" target="_blank">Ballard Locks</a> is a pretty cool sight, and you might catch the tail-end of salmon season at the fish ladder. There's also a nice botanical garden right next to the locks. Just past that is [Stone Gardens](https://www.stonegardens.com/seattle/default.aspx), which despite the name is actually a climbing gym, with very little greenery. They have lots of bouldering, or you can top-rope or lead climb (including an outdoor wall) if you pass the requisite safety tests.</p>

			<p>You'd have to get up on the earlier side to see them throw the fish, but even if you don't, <a href="http://pikeplacemarket.org/" target="_blank">Pike Place Market</a> is still worth a visit. You can find just about anything in there, from arts and crafts, to food, flowers, postcards, and <a href="https://ellenos.com/" target="_blank">Ellenos yogurt</a> (keep an eye out for free samples!). Pike Place Market is also where you can find the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_Wall" target="_blank">Gum Wall</a>, which is, well, a wall full of gum. Yum.</p>

Amazing views from the top. <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak" target="_blank">Mailbox Peak</a> is a longer (9.6 miles) and steeper (4,000 ft elevation gain) hike that will definitely make you work up a sweat.
