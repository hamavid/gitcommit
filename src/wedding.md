<h2>getting there</h2>
<p>The Abbey is at <span style='font-size:1.1em;'>[4272 Fremont Ave N](https://goo.gl/maps/MFzZhK2gA2syAqk66)</span>.</p>
<p>Parking in the surrounding neighborhood is free, but can be hard to find. The Abbey is directly on the #5 bus line, and also near the 44, E-line, 28, 62, 31, 21. If you're walking or biking, be warned it's halfway up a pretty big hill. Read more on [The Abbey's website](https://www.fremontabbey.org/about/contact/) or our [Travel &amp; Lodging](./travellodging) page.</p>
<p>The loading zone in front of the Abbey can be reserved for ADA parking upon request. Both floors of the building have ADA accessible entrances and bathrooms.

<h2>dress code</h2>
<p>Please wear whatever makes you feel comfortable, authentic, or snazzy. We are going to dress up more than we usually do. So you could do that too if you want to be like us. Or you could do something else. It's usually in the 50s and drizzling in October, but the ceremony and reception will both be indoors, in the same building.</p>
