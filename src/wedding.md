<h2>getting there</h2>
<p>The Abbey is at <span style='font-size:1.1em;'>[4272 Fremont Ave N](https://goo.gl/maps/MFzZhK2gA2syAqk66)</span>.</p>
<p>Parking in the surrounding neighborhood is free, but can be hard to find. The Abbey is directly on the #5 bus line, and also near the 44, E-line, 28, 62, 31, 21. If you're walking or biking, be warned it's halfway up a pretty big hill. Read more on [The Abbey's website](https://www.fremontabbey.org/about/contact/) or our [Lodging &amp; Travel](./lodging-and-travel) page.</p>
<p>The loading zone in front of the Abbey can be reserved for ADA parking upon request. Both floors of the building have ADA accessible entrances and bathrooms.

<h2>what to wear</h2>
<p>Please wear whatever makes you feel comfortable, authentic, or snazzy. We are going to dress up more than we usually do. So you could do that too if you want to be like us. Or you could do something else. It's usually in the 50s and drizzling in October, but the ceremony and reception will both be indoors, in the same building.</p>
<p>Also, The Abbey's [dress code](https://www.fremontabbey.org/events/about-events/) does not allow "spiked shoes". We think this means no crampons, cleats, lawn-aerators, or stilettos. (There are some nice floors to look out for.) It could also mean don't wear [these](https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g7-M00-3A-25-rBVaSlt1WPyAb6poAAGxKnOESEE365.jpg/harpelunde-men-leather-wedding-dress-shoes.jpg) but we are not really sure what the problem would be with that.</p>

<h2>jamming</h2>
<p>Many of you play music. If you think you'd have fun playing instrumental songs (Klezmer? Old time? Irish?), singing from _Rise Up Singing_ together, or making other music in a __non-performative__ setting, we would love that. Feel free to bring an instrument (we will bring some too), and ideally __let us know__, even if it's just a maybe, so we can think about space for it.</p>

<h2>chill activities</h2>
<p>For those of you who might want a break from noise or crowds, The Abbey has two floors and lots of little side rooms you can go hide in. Some of these will have puzzles, games, drawing- and jewelry-making supplies (make yourself a party favor!) and a guest book. </p>
